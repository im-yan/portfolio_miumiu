                Why in the world were we at the Hippodrome d’Auteuil, a Paris steeplechase track dating to 1873, for Miu Miu today? Miuccia Prada gave two answers as her guests queued for the post-runway buffet. <br><br>First: This is a destination show, like Gucci in Rome, Dior in Marrakech, and Prada back in New York. It must be Instagrammable, and there has to be room enough for the after-party. “We had to search for a place,” she said, and the Hippodrome fit the bill. Second, as sports go, Prada considers horse racing conservative, and she’s eager to address that subject at the moment. “If I have to say something, it’s about playing with conservatism, with glamour and fun. Conservatism is something that worries me in general.”<br><br>

                That tracks with what Prada said at the Prada show back in May, at the beginning of this two-month-long Resort season. “I’m sensitive to the political situation,” she remarked. “It affects me.”<br><br>
    
                Miu Miu’s conservatism is not what most people would recognize as such, of course. Yes, the shapes were fairly straightforward. There were high-waist shorts and double-breasted blazers with the sleeves rolled up past the elbows, printed tea dresses with Chelsea collars, and a handful of bedazzled pouf-sleeve minidresses. But—here comes the glamour and the fun—they paraded out on sky-high cork- or mirror-soled platforms worn with bobby socks. And then there were the hats: cloches or newsboys or floppy-brimmed sun hats layered over baseball caps. Assembled one on top of the other, their proportions conjured visions of Ascot. A tweaked version of Ascot; Prada said she’s never been.
